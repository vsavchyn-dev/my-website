## About
I'm Vlad, a passionate Software Engineer who finished pursuing Computer Programming & Analysis degree at Seneca Polytechnic. I'm honing my skills in <b><u>C++</u></b>, <b><u>Java</u></b>,  <b><u>Python</u></b>, and <b><u>JavaScript</u></b> to build innovative and personally challenging applications. When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new technologies, hiking, or playing games. Currently, I play "Dishonored 2" and "The Witcher". Also, check out the fun side projects that I've built in my free time below!
